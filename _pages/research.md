  <details><summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  How does identity affect occupational choice? We study this question in the energy labor market, as oil and gas firms play a fundamental role in the green transition. We design and administer a survey experiment to job seekers entering the labor market for the first time. We find that individuals assign positive amenity value to working for a company whose core business aligns with their environmental identity and disamenity value to those that conflict with it. Respondents with green identities are willing to forgo 20% of their salary to work in a renewable energy firm rather than a generic energy company, and require a 15% wage premium to accept a job in an oil and gas firm. This pattern also holds when individuals apply to work in teams focusing on clean energy within these firms. To isolate social-image effects, we randomize whether job choices are private or publicly disclosed. Social image concerns significantly influence occupational choices, especially for jobs perceived as socially stigmatized. We develop a model of occupational choice in which individuals have private preferences over jobs and derive utility from aligning with social norms. In structural simulations, we study how the social environment shapes labor market inequality and the pace of the green transition.
