I am a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am part of the Global Economics and Management Department at the Anderson School of Management. Previously, I worked as a pre-doc research assistant at the [Hub for Equal Representation in the Economy (H.E.R.)](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/HER)(https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/our-work/gender-equality/) at STICERD and at the [Centre for Economic Performance (CEP)](https://cep.lse.ac.uk) at the London School of Economics, and at the [AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University. I hold dual master’s degrees in European and International Public Policy, *cum laude*, from Bocconi University and the London School of Economics (LSE), and an undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University.  

My research interests lie in public, labour, and political economy—especially questions about how norms and values interact with household dynamics and labour-market choices. I am also broadly interested in topics related to population dynamics and education.
