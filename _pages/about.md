I am a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am part of the Global Economics and Management Department, at the Anderson School of Management. Previously, I worked as a Pre-Doc at the [Hub for Equal Representation in the economy (H.E.R.)]([https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/HER](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/our-work/gender-equality/))
(STICERD) and [Centre for Economic Performance (CEP)](https://cep.lse.ac.uk) at the London School of Economics and at the [AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality](https://www.unibocconi.eu/en/research/centres/axa-research-lab-gender-equality) at Bocconi University. I hold a Double masterâ€™s degree in European and International Public Policy *cum laude* from Bocconi University and the London School of Economics (LSE), and an undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University.  

My research interests lie in the fields of public, labour and political economy, especially in questions related to how norms and values interact with household dynamics and choices on the labour markets. I am also broadly interested in questions related to topics in population dynamics and education.
