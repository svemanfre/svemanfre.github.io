I am a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am part of the Global Economics and Management Department at the Anderson School of Management. Previously, I worked at the [Hub for Equal Representation in the Economy (H.E.R.)](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/our-work/gender-equality/) at STICERD and at the [Centre for Economic Performance (CEP)](https://cep.lse.ac.uk) at the London School of Economics, and at the [AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University. I hold dual masterâ€™s degrees in European and International Public Policy, from Bocconi University and the London School of Economics (LSE), and an undergraduate degree (B.Sc) in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University.  

I am interested in public, labour, and political economy, with a particular focus on how structural transformation shapes norms and values, and in turn, household dynamics and labour-market choices. More broadly, I am also interested issues related to population dynamics and education.
