  <h3>Masterclass: Research Skills Development</h3>
  <p>
    I co-developed this masterclass with <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/people/academic-staff/almudena-sevilla" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Almudena Sevilla</a> and
    <a href="https://pilarcuevasruiz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilar Cuevas</a>. It’s a hands-on set of sessions to help early-career researchers build practical skills for doing and communicating research.

  <p>
    I wrote this guide after going through the PhD application process myself and drawing on my experience as a pre-doc. There are all the feedbacks and small things I wish I’d known.
